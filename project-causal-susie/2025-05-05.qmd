## Recall ...

We aim to apply the proposed IPW based causal SuSiE method on GWAS dataset.

The biggest challenge up to now is that, when treating each variant as a categorical variable, class imbalanced is inevitable: for some exposure variable $X$, many objects are with $X=0$, whereas only a few objects are with $X=1$ or $X=2$.

The class imbalance brings trouble to estimating the propensity scores, i.e., $\operatorname{Pr}(X=k|U), k=0, 1, 2$.

To address this problem, I guess there are two ways:

-   \(1\) Apply this method on another dataset with less severe class imbalance.

-   \(2\) Still treating each variant as categorical variables, but we use another causal inference method that avoids estimating the propensity score.

-   \(3\) We no longer treat those variants as categorical variables. Instead, we treat them as continuous variables and assume they have additive effects.
